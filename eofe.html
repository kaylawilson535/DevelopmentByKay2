                    INTRODUCTION
                </h4>
                <p>
                    End of Exile is an immersive VR experience in which Carrie, the disgraced high school teacher in a family of billionaires, joins a national tournament held by a deep sea, technologically-advanced city full of out-of-this-world challenges. 
                </p>

                <h4>
                    DESCRIPTION
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Your great-great-great uncle committed a horrific act that exiled your entire bloodline from a mysterious nation and in turn, created a missing link in your family history. This is until one day, a strange man shows up on the back of an even stranger creature and offers your family a deal; if you can place first in the bi-centurial national competition then the disgrace of your family’s name will finally be lifted. You eagerly enter the novel, deep sea, and technologically-advanced nation, quickly finding yourself in challenges as strange as the city. Challenges include using sonar to navigate underwater and avoid being shot at by opponents. Fly on the backs of magnificent creatures and throw balls through goals while dodging others’ creatures. Test the loyalties of others with decisive team shooting games. Jump, duck, and swing from ropes to finish the endurance course in as little time as possible. And at any point that you aren’t competing, train in order to level up in armor, draft picks, and loyalty offered by your teammates and competitors alike. And with just enough training, you might be able to save your family’s name and gain citizenship. Or will your status within your family fall even lower than before?
                </p>

                <h4>
                    KEY FEATURES
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Make decisions on who to eliminate and who to keep around based solely on levels of trust and loyalty those players have demonstrated in the past as well as considering the risk and reward of jeopardizing your own levels of loyalty or trust to gain quick tournament points. <br>
                    Use interactive sound while underwater to race through obstacles and avoid being shot at by fellow competitors also navigating the water with sound.<br>
                    Have every challenge and training count, either toward new armors, better weapons, more advanced technologies, higher loyalties, or stylish outfits.<br>
                    Co-op mode allows you, the VR headset user, to work alongside your teammate using a game controller and communication to advance through a set of challenges.<br>

                <h4>
                    SIMILAR GAME
                </h4>
                <p>
                    SIMS is similar to one of the mini games Carrie will compete in centered around relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actions: Interact with people and based on the interactions that are chosen, either create happy relationships, or sour relationships. All interactions are kept track of in a database and using AI, creates the type of relationship that would be formed as a result of your actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rules: You are restricted to the two or three options that the game provides you. For instance, you can be nice, happy, or mean. But you can’t be passive aggressively angry about that time they dog sat, and your dog got sick
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goals: Form the relationships you want to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objects: Houses, pets, food, furniture, buildings, locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Play Space: The city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players: You control your character; the rest of the “players” are based on AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My game would have extremely similar AI for keeping track of how you treat people. The main difference will be that instead of your actions producing displays of emotion (ex: Your mean and the AI player cries), your actions will instead determine how these other players treat you as an opponent and a teammate. So, if your mean, maybe they don’t pass you the ball and you have less opportunity to level up your accuracy points.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    OBJECTIVES
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Win as many matches and games as possible to level up “champion points”, thus making you the champion. This Doc will focus on the design doc of one of the mini games that is played during the tournament. In the “relationships” minigame, goals include, not being eliminated, eliminating others, maintaining high levels of trust and loyalty, and advancing through as many rounds as possible. 
                </p>

                <h4>
                    MECHANICS
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You will play in VR, first person, and continuously. Your first-person avatar will be played through means of a VR headset. Your co-op machine will play either as an AI or with another person using a controller. Whichever way is chosen, the two players will play simultaneously.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    RULES
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A player begins with three lives. If a machine lands a shot on them, they lose one of those lives. If they manage to raise their arm and the shot hits their forearm shield, they will not lose a life. The player and their levitating machine work cooperatively to try and eliminate opponents before they themselves are eliminated. If their machine manages to hit an opponent, that opponent loses a life. The only way to score is by advancing rounds. There is one point for advancing from rounds one to two. There are two points for advancing from rounds two to three. There are three points for the sole survivor of the third and final round. The first round will be played in two teams of 8. Once all 8 players of one team are eliminated, all 8 players of the surviving team move onto round two, regardless of whether they were eliminated in this round since they were still apart of the winning team. In the second round, the remaining eight players will be split into four teams of two. Once one team is completely eliminated the remaining three teams once again advance, regardless of elimination status since their teammate participated on the winning team. In the final round, the six remaining players will be playing as individuals. To prevent the doubles from sticking together, eliminating your doubles partner from the previous round will provide you with immunity for a couple of minutes. All players will have “loyalty” meters above their head that are accumulated not only throughout the game but throughout the last ten games played.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    CONTROLS
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Physically ducking, jumping, and moving your head side to side, will also cause the on screen, first player avatar to duck, jump, and dodge, respectively. In addition, one of the touch controllers will be tracked for position to allow the on-screen avatar’s arm to raise and defend themselves against oncoming fire. Also, in this game, the player will be playing co-op either with an AI or with another person. If with another person, the additional person will play the game with a controller using their left toggle to maneuver their on-screen levitating machine, the right toggle to aim, and then the triggers to fire at opponents.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    STORY
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Carrie, the disgraced high school teacher in a family of billionaires, joins a national tournament held by a deep sea, technologically-advanced city full of out-of-this-world challenges. She fights through different mini games, the most prominent one being the “relationship game” gaining championship points. Her ultimate goal is to obtain enough championship points to be crowned champion at which point the national disgrace will be lifted from her family’s name and allow her to rejoin the country as a citizen.

                <h4>
                    GRAPHICS STYLE
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The game is going to be futuristic but also a little simple. The simplicity is due to the time constraint. And the futuristic theme is supposed to give the entire city an interesting feel similar to the feel of Wakanda in Black Panther. The user should have a sense of “this has been here all along and I had no idea?” It should also serve as a bit of an escape of reality for our bored main character. The bright colors and zooming transportation are exhilarating and make the player want to live there forever. The players themselves are going to all be human and have a few variations such as hairstyle, shape, and clothes. They will be randomly generated combinations of those three unique identifiers and bustling in the city in between individual games. Inside of the games themselves, for simplicity sake, each teammate and opponent will be in a head to toe suit and helmet so that only one suit/helmet needs to be modelled. These models will have varying designs in the form of texture wraps and color in order to distinguish them from one another. Game elements will be colorful much like the city, with glowing neon surfaces.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    CHARACTERS
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I plan to give the main character an option to customize. There will be a minimal amount to minimize, hair style and color, skin color, shape, and gender. The face will be rarely zoomed in on, even in thematic conversations, the camera perspective will be more similar to SIMS, overhead and far away so that no specific faces are shown. This will allow the player a better feel of stepping into the character’s shoes. The clothes will also be customizable and there will be silly upgrades throughout the game for the player to invest in. Weird hats, cool jackets. Similar to how Fortnight always has new “skins” coming out. This will give the player small goals to work on while working toward the larger goal of being champion. As mentioned before, characters within the minigames will all have a very similar 3d model with the main variations coming into play with colors of their suits. The suits I envision to be similar to those that were in Tron.

                <h4>
                    DEVELOPMENT DIFFICULTIES 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Integrating co-op play where one person is in an immersive VR experience wearing a headset and the other is using a controller and a game screen but the two are interacting in the same play space will likely cause the most difficulty. I will be creating the game with an AI co-op first in case the controller becomes unmanageable, the game will still be playable.<p>I also foresee graphics being a large issue. I am not particularly skilled at creating digital art and think I may have to settle for some simpler renditions of things so long as the “idea” is getting across the screen.</p>
                    
                    
                </p>

                <h4>
                    DEVELOPMENT SCALE
                </h4>
                <h5>
                    Smaller  
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Less minigames, shorter thematic intro to story, no two-player co-op, less whimsical milestones (clothes/artifacts to buy in between racking up championship points)
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Larger
                </h5>
                <p>
                    More minigames, better 3d modelling and animations, more artifacts and interactivity in between playing games to rack up points. Maybe a chance to explore the city in an open world format. Have the training for the mini games contain more AI elements.
                </p>
